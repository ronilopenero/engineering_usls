			<p class="brief">BACOLOD CITY - As part of its mission of sharing and giving in communion with the community, the College of Engineering and Technology student council organized outreach programs and activities that helped out partner communities and inculcated the spirit of volunteerism among students.</p><p class="brief">The council had chosen ABKASA Elementary School in Brgy. Mandalagan as its partner school. Last June 4, 2013, the council, together with the engineering clubs, visited the grade one pupils. They entertained them and gave them snacks and school supplies like  notebooks and crayons. The pupils reciprocated the deeds of the volunteers by offering their warmest smiles and gratitude.</p><p class="brief">During the Lasallian Week celebration, the council participated in “La Salle Gives Back” which is a series of simultaneous activities which gives an opportunity for the clubs and college councils to help the less fortunate. The grade four pupils of ABKASA Elementary School were invited to visit the campus. The council showed enthusiasm in welcoming them. The pupils and their guardians were entertained and they were given snacks and plenty of give-aways. When they bid farewell, the pupils couldn’t help but to embrace and thank the members of the council who put their Engineering Student Leaders preparing to reach out to the environment great efforts in preparing for the event.</p><p class="brief">Gawad Kalinga was also one of the beneficiaries of the engineering council. They never missed a chance to participate and help out in GK’s outreach programs especially at the GK village in Brgy. Dulao, Bago City.</p><p class="brief">As an answer to the call of awareness and action towards protecting and conserving the environment, the council joined in every outreach programs initiated by the Balayan and the engineering faculty. These include coastal clean-ups and mangrove planting in various areas in Negros Occidental. Through these, the goals to make engineering students aware of the current state of the environment and to encourage and inspire them to become volunteers in saving the earth were all achieved.</p><p class="brief">Governor Ryan Jake Pisueña collectively called these community outreach and spiritual activities in an adopted barangay or community as BAYAN-e outreach program. This is a new project of the college council which aims to bring out the hero that lies in the heart of every engineering student by taking an active role in alleviating poverty, preserving the environment and building better future for the Filipino people.</p>

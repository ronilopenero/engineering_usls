			<p class="brief">UNIVERSITY OF ST. LA SALLE - Showing off one’s college hardly seems uncommon these days, as each student finds ways, sometimes almost instantly, on how to advertise their colleges to the new freshmen.</p>

			<h4> What is the Orange Week?</h4>

			<p class="brief">It is the college’s way of inviting you to immerse yourselves not just in engineering academics but also in the culture that has been growing continuously in this college. This year’s theme is “Roar Louder, Stand Prouder, Brave Orange Warriors”. This is also one of the early times in the year where the clubs are given the chance to invite students to be a part of their family. Academic clubs for each of the majors, and also special, non-academic clubs are stationed by the library corridor.</p><p class="brief">It was a week filled with activities and bonding moments for the students. especially during the culminating activity which was a sort of mini-variety show at the Eras station involving different dance and song numbers. It also helped break the ice between the “higher years” and the “first years”, as there were interactive activities and games. It was a great time to kick-start the year and hopefully, it’ll also be the start of an even brighter future for the students.</p><p class="brief">One of the major activities for the first semester was the foundation week. It is a week celebrated in honor of the founding of the school; a week where we get to experience the heritage of the university and also a glimpse of its past. This year’s had much more in store than anyone at the college could’ve ever guessed. The annual agape lunch was present, as with its college traditional tikal-tikal contest. But this year’s venue was the newly constructed spot in between the buildings, and it proved to be quite ideal for the contest. But what everyone was really looking forward to was the annual Club Wars! This time, it wasn’t in the field, but at the Eras station. And sure enough, it seemed like a weird venue, but soon it proved all of us wrong. The whole game was tweaked with a new twist. Round one was patterned after the Spartans versus Persians battle, where one club had to defend itself against all the other clubs throwing their balloons without mercy and trying to get your president wet and dirty with dye. Round two gave the other bullied clubs a chance to get even, as it was a free-for-all round, stationed along the road. After a wet afternoon, with aching bodies and tired but happy faces, only one club could reign as this year’s club wars champion. And the crown went to JPICHE with Agnes Casiano as the cleanest president amongst them.</p>
